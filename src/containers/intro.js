                <p> This app is like the moldy residue of the web app store, no lie. Like, 
                I'm pretty sure that if this app was a person, this person would be the
                kind of person to not tell you that you have a shit stain on your pants
                before a big interview. If you use this app, It's like you intentionally
                play ranked warzone on that shitbox of a laptop you own... from 2006.
                <br/>
                you're just asking to lose, bruh. don't use this app.<br/>
                please. </p>
